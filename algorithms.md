1. Iteration vs Recursion (e.g. binary search)
<br>Recursion solves the problem by function itself, feed the result back into function.
<br>While Iteration use loops to repeat a set of instructions
<br><mark>Recursion is usually slower than iteration due to the overhead of maintaining the stack. Recursion uses more 
memory than iteration. Recursion makes the code smaller.</mark>

2. Dynamic Programming 
   - Why DP performs better than recursion with memo?
    <br>Ans: DP does not need extra space to store computed results from recursion.
